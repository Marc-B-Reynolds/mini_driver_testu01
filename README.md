# mini_driver_testu01
A wrapper and tools for running some [TestU01](https://github.com/umontreal-simul/TestU01-2009/) battery tests for both PRNGs and scaffolding for bit finalizers (hash mixing steps).

The minimal documentation is in [mini_testu01.md.html](mini_testu01.md.html) which is a [markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) document (client-side rendered markdown with bells and whistles) so won't properly display as a github preview.  It is also very incomplete because this is a hacky personal tool that I'm just tossing out in support for another repo: [vprng](https://github.com/Marc-B-Reynolds/vprng).
