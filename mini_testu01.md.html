                      **Mini Driver TestU01**

This is a small convenience wrapper around the empirical testing library [TestU01](https://github.com/umontreal-simul/TestU01-2009/) primarily written for testing *bit finalizing* functions.

`TestU01` was originally released in 2007 and the most current official version is from 2009. Therefore is has some `bit-rot` related issues.  The two main ones are:

1. Designed around 32-bit hardware so statistical tests are designed to operate on 32-bit chunks.  So testing PRNGs and bit-finalizers that yield 64-bits (or more) need to jump though hoops to test all of the their output.
2. The design also assumes single-core and single-threaded operation. Note although 64-bit and muticore consumer hardware started appearing a couple of years eariler I'm not criticizing the authors for this choice.  Their expected number of users was approximately zero and consists of academic researchers/grad students. Plus, of course, the fact that proper multithreaded is a extra PITA.

!!! TIP
    **SORRY:** Just a stub of documentation.


Set-up
==============================================================

xxx


Running
==============================================================

`TestU01` is composed of a large number of parameterized statistical tests which are grouped to [*batteries*](#batteries) for convenience. This program only wraps executing a subset of the batteries (listed below). Each statistical test can produce one or more statistics. The number of statistics produced for a given test might vary depending on the sample size it is given.

## source

### file based

### internal

## output

## p-values

A statistic's [p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) $(p)$ is mapped to a test value $(t)$ by:

$$ t = \text{min}\left(p,1-p\right)$$

which is then compared against three threshold values:

| type       | command line     | default       | color |
| :---       | :---             | ---:          |:---:  |
| report     | `--pshow=VALUE`  | disabled      |plain  |
| suspicious | `--psus=VALUE`   | 0.001         |yellow |
| error      | `--perror=VALUE` | $2^{-40}$     |red    |



Batteries
==============================================================

Only one battery can executed per run.


## Alphabit

`--alphabit=[BLOCKS]` `--block=[BLOCKS]`

The battery is the following 9 tests:

* `smultin_MultinomialBitsOver (L = {2,4,8,16})`
* `sstring_HammingIndep        (L = {16,32} bits)`
* `sstring_HammingCorr         (L = 32 bits)`
* `swalk_RandomWalk1           (length L = {64,320})`


## Rabbit

`--rabbit=[BLOCKS]`

The battery setup contains a *defect* where it can attempt to drawn more than the specified number samples. This will cause it to "barf" (exit w/o output) if reading from a file. So for file reads this program limits the specified size to half of that of file size and issues a warning.

!!! TIP
    **NOTE:** The test `smultin_MultinomialBitsOver` in rabbit is a specialized version (SEE `DoMultinom` in `battery.c`) which consistently produces warning or errors including when being run on *real random* datafiles. Conversely other batteries which run the non-specialized version version of the test do not on the same data. The driver does **not** filter these out but marks the test in reporting (and any totals from this test are including in the summary). I should probably add an option to filter out.

The battery is the following 26 tests:

* `smultin_MultinomialBitsOver`
* `snpair_ClosePairsBitMatch (t = {2,4})`
* `svaria_AppearanceSpacings`
* `scomp_LinearComp`
* `scomp_LempelZiv`
* `sspectral_Fourier1`
* `sspectral_Fourier3`
* `sstring_LongestHeadRun`
* `sstring_PeriodsInStrings`
* `sstring_HammingWeight (L = 32 bits)`
* `sstring_HammingCorr   (L = {32,64,128} bits)`
* `sstring_HammingIndep  (L = {16,32,64} bits)`
* `sstring_AutoCor       (lag d = {1,2}).`
* `sstring_Run`
* `smarsa_MatrixRank with 32 × 32 matrices.`
* `smarsa_MatrixRank with 320 × 320 matrices.`
* `smarsa_MatrixRank with 1024 × 1024 matrices.`
* `swalk_RandomWalk1 with walks of length L = 128.`
* `swalk_RandomWalk1 with walks of length L = 1024.`
* `swalk_RandomWalk1 with walks of length L = 10016`
